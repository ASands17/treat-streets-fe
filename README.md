## Abstract

- Treat Streets was created using GraphQL in the React.js framework. This Halloween themed application is meant to give trick-or-treaters and parents more information about participating homes in their area. The application allows users to view a map of houses in their area who are registered to be giving out candy for Halloween and to register their own house to be added to the map.  

## Deployed Link
